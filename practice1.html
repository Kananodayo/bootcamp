    <h1>Understanding Blood and Components</h1>
    <p>Blood is a fluid that flows throughout the body in blood vessels. Blood is needed for life. Blood carries oxygen and nutrients to your organs and tissues and helps remove waste. Blood also helps you fight infections and heal from injuries. This sheet tells you more about blood and its important role in your body.</p>
    <h2>What are the components of blood?</h2>
    <p>Blood can be broken down into different parts <strong>(components)</strong> . These components include red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, and plasma.</p>
    <br>
    <h3>Red blood Cells</h3>
    <p>carry <i>oxygen</i>  to the body. Each RBC lives for about 4 months. RBCs contain a protein called <i><b>hemoglobin</b></i> . Hemoglobin allows RBCs to pick up oxygen from the lungs. Iron is needed to make hemoglobin</p>

    <h3>White Blood Cells</h3>
    <p>are part of the body’s immune system. WBCs help fight <u>infections and diseases</u> . There are different types of WBCs. These include <em>neutrophils, lymphocytes, monoctyes, esinophils, and basophils</em> . WBCs live for hours, days, months, or years depending on the specific type.</p>

    <h3>Platelets</h3>
    <p>are cells that help with <em><strong>clotting</strong></em> . When you have a cut or bruise, platelets come together to form a clot or “plug.” This helps to control bleeding, so your body doesn’t lose too much blood. Platelets live in the body for about <strong>7 to 10 days</strong> .</p>
    <hr>
    <h3>Plasma</h3>
    <p>is the liquid portion of blood. It carries the different types of blood cells to all the parts of the body. Plasma also  <u>carries proteins including clotting factors</u> . Clotting factors help platelets with the <i>clotting process</i> .</p>
